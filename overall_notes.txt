**To serve as taking notes throughout the process of what needs to be done or created in order to fulfill this app**

- Need a sheet specifically for the Magic Item Tables along with the conditions of the rolls that equal magic items
    * In Progress *

- Need to also look at other DnD books to verify if there are any other Magic Random Item rolls to include in additional
    sheets or organization


- End result:
    Would have a main page asking what the user wants to do for individual hordes/group hordes or just random item
        events that include money/magic items at random of anything magic related in all DnD books
